# CE326-Solutions

A collection of exam solutions for the Concurrent Programming course at the University of Thessaly's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

The solutions are expressed in C-like pseudocode using the notation shown in the course for the various synchronization primitives.

I wonder if the corresponding exams are uploaded somewhere...
